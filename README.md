# deep_learning_notebooks
The repository includes Jupyter notebooks with deep learning examples in Python.
Some of the code parts are adopted from and influenced by the Udemy's TensorFlow Developer Certificate in 2022: Zero to Mastery.
All the experiments and my path to learning TensorFlow is described in blog posts at 
[https://daehnhardt.com](https://daehnhardt.com/blog/).
Please feel free to reuse the code and trained models, and let me know what you think.
I would be very thankful for your feedback.
